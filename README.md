# M-M-1-queue-
The goal of this project was to simulate an M/M/1 queue,  that assumes customers come according to a poisson process with a rate of 0.5 people per minutes and the service time, which follows an exponential distribution with a mean of 3 minutes.  The mean waiting time for the system was then calculated from the simulation.
